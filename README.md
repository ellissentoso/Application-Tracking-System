## Application Tracking System
About The Project
I created a simple Application Tracking System to ensure that job seekers save time and make each application count for
the job they apply for. It matches whether one's resume is properly tailored to the job one applies for, and whether
it would have the slightest chance in getting read by the employer.

A list resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
